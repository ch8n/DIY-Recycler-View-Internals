# Create your own Recycler View
Recycler view is one of the major UI component of Android Ecosystem,
and Most popular resource to learn it from is [RecyclerView ins and outs - Google I/O 2016](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LqBlYJTfLP4&t=1797s)

This Video Complete lots of inside detail of Recycler View but doesn't show any code 
to relate, so I have decided to step in for that, taking diagrams and flows discussed in
the video I have tried to implement my own Recycler View, Which you can related to while understanding the video
or use it ace your next technical interview.

So, help yourself and have a snack on the Code and as Always Happy Hacking!

Chetan Gupta.
